## Reflections and Comments

* **Daily Reflections**: This project helped me practice basic HTML structuring and JavaScript interactivity through a guessing game. Setting up score tracking and validating inputs were valuable exercises for future user-interactive projects.
* **Learning Highlights**: Improved understanding of loops, conditional statements, and accessibility best practices through Chrome's Lighthouse tool. Gained confidence in structuring and debugging JavaScript code.
* **Challenges**: Adjusting the app’s accessibility scores in Lighthouse highlighted areas to improve semantic HTML and interactive elements for user experience. 

### Future Enhancements

* Refactoring code for better DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.
* Adding more interactive elements and animations to enhance user engagement.
